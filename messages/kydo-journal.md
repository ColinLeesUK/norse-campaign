# Message from Kydos to Ingemar

I like your journal, Ingemar. I have one too but there's not much space left for writing anymore.  So I thought I'd write in yours. Would you be able to lend me a few hundred gold for a nice new journal...? I'm sure you'd like one too...I could help you get good discount with my exceptional charisma.
