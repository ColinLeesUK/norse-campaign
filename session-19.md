# Session 19 -

*Friday. Day 53. Week 8 of campaign. 4th week of March*.

Taking a short rest after the battle the party decied to head back to The Manticore's Tail, leaving into the sewers Leena notices that there are tracks over footsteps the party made on their way into the hideout. They assume these are of Arnulf from the ECG.

Seeing these they decied to follow them and see if they can catch Arnulf. Alan decieds to take the form of a woodpecker to try and follow these footprints. The footprints seem to be heading in the opposite direction to The Manticore's Tail. These tracks head under the market and into the slum district, the thieves hideout.

Heading to a door in the wall Leena opens it with ease and the party head into the house. Leena and Alan decied to scope out the house ensuring to stay quiet, following the tracks they see that Arnulf headed straight to the front door and out into the town. A busy street greets the party outside, obscuring any tracks that might of been visable.

As this is where the trail ends for the moment the party head to the Castle to meet with Guthrim to take a message to the Yarl. Leaving a message with Guthrim about the incriminating documents, he returns and says that the party are to leave the documents with Guthrim and return with a report on the activity in the valley.

Alan imediatly flies off not wanting to part with the documents to anyone bar the yarl, with the rest of the party following they head to The Manticore's Tail. Whilst resting the party write up the report to the yarl.

``` Plain Text
Report to Yarl Vot Kettelson.

We have made contact with the Shaman's at the tree. They are a proud tribe of Minators that say they are the ones that have summoned the giants. Their plans are to rid the valley of any other races as they believe they are encroaching into the valley and destroying the natural balance.

We have found out first hand that they can transform into adult dragons and have control over, have domesticated or are aligned with dragons.

During the planning of a scouting mission of the hill giants the assassination attempt occured, which weighleide our plans.

We are heading out for our scouting mission in the morning.

Order of the Gjallarhorn

After writing the report the party head out to the castle again to talk to the Yarl. Kydos and Erp stay at The Manticore's Tail resting for the moment to recover. Guthrim meets them at the gate and shows them through the castle to the Yarl's study. The Yarl asks what reward we would want for removing the Druids from the Valley.

Rewards:

- Information on Tofi, Thane Colfin and Herdis
- An appropriate increase to the Kolsonafel budget
- Trade route to Kolsonafel

The Yarl agrees to investigate Tofi and his movement and an increase to the budget of Kolsonafel. He cannot agree trade routes to Kolsonafel. Vot Kettleson wants a report as soon as we return from the valley. Guthrim informs us that he has now been made a Sturaesman, impressed by the new rank Leena flirts with him and sets up a date for when she returns from the valley.

Returning to The Manticore's Tail they regail Kydos with stories of what happened with the Yarl. Enjoying a fun evening with all the party Ingemar and Alan have a dice role game while Leena, Kydos and Hamming have a drinking competition.

In the morning the party head back to the castle to deliver the Assassin to the Yarl as he requested. She is to be executed for being a theif and assassin. Meeting Guthrim at the keep he informs the party that Releal has been arrested for high treason along with two of the guards.

Keeping true to their word the party head to the heavens gate and into the valley to investigate the hill giant tribe. As they party head into the valley they see a small cyclonic thunder storm above where the druid tree is located.

Journeying on the party come across nothign and decied to bed down for the evening. Waing int he morning the party head out into the forest and happen across an offering shrine to the shemanic tribe.
