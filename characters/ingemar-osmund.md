# Ingemar Osmund

Only child in a high class family, great expectations set on his shoulders. Sent to the poshes schools and rode on the tails of some natural tallent that he had. With this natural talent he assumed that the world was owed to him and people would give him anything he wanted, however, as the years we on and the school lessons got harder things changed. Thinking he never had to learn as he never had before he started to fail and this angered his family perticularly his father.

Sent out into the real world after being caught trying to cheat on his final exams Ingemar is out in the world to show his family that they will regret treating him in this way.
