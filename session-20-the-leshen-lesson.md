# Session 20 - The Leshen Lesson

*Sunday. Day 55. Week 8 of campaign. 4th week of March*.

Seeing the shamanic shrine Alan decieds to investigate and see what this shrine is for. The shirne itself was a collection of old bone with moss growing over, a large stag head placed a top and a platform in the center.

Alan notices two cross shaped bones with a does head to the eft and right of the shrine. Walkign towards this stag shrine and looks up into a tree to see dozens of ravens looking towards the party. Moving forward the ravens all fly towards Alan, collect together and a creature rises from the center; a Leshen ![Leshen](images/creatures/leshen.jpg).

The Leshen attacks the party, standing 12ft tall this monster towers over the party protecting his land. Along side this wooden goliath growl three dire wolves spawned from thin air. During the battle this giant creature could teleport around and summon more wolves to help in the battle.

After the battle Alan realises that as he was walking up to the shrines first and was attacked by the Leshen he may have been cursed by these shrines. Resting up for the night to regain their strength the party set out again for the Hill Giant tribe.

*Monday. Day 55. Week8 of Campaign. 4th Week of March*.

Waking on Monday morning the party head out and travel south for the day, nothing much happens during this day but good movement is made towards the hill giants tribe. Finding a safe feeling spot the party bed down taking watch for the night. As the sun rises on Tuesday morning, moving out the party can already hear the sound of the great river they are approaching. Having already had trouble with crossing rivers the party take some time to try and asses the best way to cross this river... as this happens Kydos jumps into the river and is taken down by the flow of the water.

- Kydos jumps in but trips
- Kydos horse follows watching her in the river
- Ingemar tries to lasso Kydos but ties up his horse
- Leena tries to throw Alan in but the two just end up in an awkward grapple
- Kydos grabs onto the bank of the river

Deciding that this was a silly idea, the party head to find a more sutble part of the river to cross. After walkign for a fe hourse they happen appon the mouth of the river which is a flatter part of the river allowing for easier passage across. Resting up after this ordeal they decied to head out towards the Hill Giants trying to gain information.

*Tuesday. Day 57. Week 9 of Campaign. 5th Week of March*.

By 4-5 o'clock in the afternoon the party breach out of the tree line to look upon a huge house which is holding back the water from the river, beyond that is a village of tents which seem to be sized to be that of gnomes. Looking a little closer Ingemar and Alan notice that this looks to be more of Goblin architecture. The amount of tents shows around 30-40 tents and the sizes of the buildings would house around 20-30 giants. It would seem that the tents would hold between 5-8 golbins.

Transforming into an owl Alan decides to get a birds eye view of the situation of the Goblin village, traveling on the ground with Alan Leena sends her familiar, Halvard the weasel in. Looking throught the village Alan and the weasel see a larger tent in the middle which they explore, it seems to be some sort of brewery/tavern/kitchen which is the center of activity for the Goblins. There is one larger Goblin sat in there clearly some form of capitan as he is more heavily armed than any of the other Golbins in this tavern.

After seeing this Alan moves onto the large house at the dam and takes a look in. This is one large hall filled wwith Giant sized furniture with a huge waggon at one end, sat upon this wagon is a grotesquely large gaint female who seems to be the cheif of this tribe.

Alan and Erp turn into flies, fly into building banish fat giant, turn into owls try to loot some treasure get hit. Dimension door out and then long rest.

*Thursday. Day 59. Week 9 of campaign. 5th Week of March*.
