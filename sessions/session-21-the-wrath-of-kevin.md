# Session 21 - The wrath of Kevin

*Thursday. Day 59. Week 9 of campaign. 5th Week of March*.

After the encounter Alan and Erp returned to the party and regailed them with their adventures stating that a logn rest is needed to regain their strength.

Esuring there is a watch roter the party rest late into the evening, gathering their equipment the party use the same scouting technique of owl and weasel.

After returning Alan and Leena recap the rest of the party about the happenings of the Goblin and Giant tribe. The giants are fighting amoungst each other to gain control over the tribe, the goblins are mobalising their infantry getting ready for some sort of war.

Figuring that the best time to attack would be in the morning after the battles have died down and people are at their weakest, the party bed down for the night awaiting the battle.

Leena decieds that sending Kevin out to try and cause some havok by burning down as many of the tents as possible. Unfortunatly the goblins spot this weasel immediatly and kick Kevin into a wall.

Deciding that was a silly idea the party rest for the evening.

Waking in the morning the party head out for the giant camp. Failing to be at all stealthy the party are imedatly spotted and must push through to fight the oncomming golbin hoard.

## Goblin camp battle

After the grand battle the party had slain the whole Golbin camp, laying waste to all they saw. Over 100 goblin bodies lay about the floor, tents ablaze and ground scorched. Looking up towards the Giants house Ingemar noticed that two of the giants were stood watching the battle.

Seeing their chance to escape and rest before taking on the hill giants the party head for their camp in the woods to rest for the night.
