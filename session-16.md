*Day 15, Wednesday*.

The party arrive back to [Kastiliborg](locations/kastiliborg.md) tierd and weiry from their travels, wishing for nothing more than a bath, warm meal and a soft bed they head to the [Manticore's Tail](localtions/kastiliborg/manticores-tail.md). Tied up outside they find two horses they have not seen before, wearily they enter. Within the party find Komaz eating a meal with a human and goliath, [Hamming](characters/hamming.md) and [Orm](characters/orm.md).

Hamming greats the party with might bear hugs, causing damage to half of the party. The druid seeing what is happening quickly turns himself into a bear to ensure he can give an appropriate embrace.

Orm informs the party that the Yarl has ordered Hamming and Orm to join the party and asks for an update on what the party have been doing. He also asks for an update on Tofi.

The party update the two on the happenings within the past few weeks. Komaz asks if the party have eaten and offers to cook them some dinner. Handing over the dragon steaks Komaz makes dragon steaks for the party.

Deciding that everyone needs a rest the party head to bed, enjoying a warm, comfy bed for the first time in a few days.

During the evening Leena wakes with a sharp stabbing pain in the chest, opening her eyes she sees a short sword plunged into her sternum. She sees a hooded figure, a Drough standing over her...

> "The guild sends their regards."

At the same time Alan is also stabbed during his sleep, a half-elf. At this moment Alan reacts and turns into a Polar bear and roars.

## Assassin Battle
